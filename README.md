# ECLIPSE
![ECLIPSE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e44873a-b8b3-4f5c-9d53-f79d86511223)

**ECLIPSE** is a next-generation, cross-platform desktop application designed to transform any modern Windows or Linux workstation into a **fully featured, zero-cost embedded-systems and IoT simulation lab**. Targeted at students, hobbyists, educators, and developers on a budget, ECLIPSE removes the need for physical Raspberry Pi or Arduino hardware by delivering high-fidelity, real-time virtual twins of these platforms.

---

> **Project Status: Early Development**  
> ECLIPSE is currently in its early stages of development. This repository is intended for early documentation, planning, and community feedback. The first public releases and builds are not yet available. Stay tuned for updates!

## Key Features *(upon planned release)*

- **Virtual Embedded Boards:**  
  Emulates Raspberry Pi (1/4/Pico), Arduino (AVR), and RP2040 boards as fully interactive digital twins—including GPIO, I²C, SPI, PWM, serial, and sensor modules.

- **No Hardware Required:**  
  Experiment, test, and learn embedded programming without buying or wiring physical boards.

- **Powerful Emulation Engine:**  
  - Uses [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) for dynamic binary translation (ARM on x86/x64 hosts).
  - Modular board profiles via JSON descriptors (CPUs, pins, memory, peripherals).
  - Realistic memory, CPU, and resource management—complete with simulated out-of-memory conditions.

- **Modular & Extensible:**  
  - Drag-and-drop sensors and peripherals (temperature, accelerometer, OLED, etc.) onto virtual boards.
  - Add new modules with Python scripts—no need to recompile C++.

- **Modern UI (Qt 6/QML):**  
  - Animated, responsive dashboards.
  - Split-view code editor (C++ & MicroPython support).
  - Live console/debug panel.
  - Real-time charts and data visualization.
  - Project/session management with SQLite.

- **Built-in Python Interpreter:**  
  Run data analysis, machine learning, or signal processing scripts directly in the simulation environment.

- **Collaboration & Plugins (Planned):**  
  - Planned LAN-based pairing for labs and remote instruction (Phase 4+).
  - Plugin marketplace for community boards, sensors, and analytics modules (Phase 6+).
  - Future macOS support.

## Vision

ECLIPSE aims to **democratize hands-on embedded systems education**. By virtualizing popular development boards and peripherals, it empowers anyone with a laptop to:

- Write, test, and debug embedded code _without soldering or physical hardware_.
- Quickly iterate on projects and ideas, risk-free.
- Access high-quality hardware simulation, regardless of budget or geography.

Perfect for:
- Underserved schools and remote classrooms.
- Makerspaces, workshops, and self-learners.
- Professionals prototyping before hardware investment.

## Architecture Overview

- **Core Engine:**  
  C++20, QEMU (ARM), Renode (AVR/RP2040), modular plugin system.
- **UI:**  
  Qt 6/QML, animated 2D/3D board visualizer, embedded WebEngine widgets.
- **Persistence:**  
  Session and project state in SQLite.
- **Extensibility:**  
  Python scripting via PyBind11 for rapid sensor/peripheral integration.
