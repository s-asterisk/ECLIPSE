# Lab Management  
*Coordinating virtual hardware labs for education and teams*  

## Overview  
ECLIPSE lab management enables:  
- **Classroom Orchestration**: Simultaneous deployment of identical virtual boards to student groups  
- **Resource Allocation**: Fair scheduling of GPU/CPU-intensive simulations  
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for students/TAs/instructors  
- **Automated Grading**: Integration with testing frameworks for instant feedback  

## Key Features  
1. **Resource Scheduling**  
   - Calendar-based reservation system  
   - Hardware profile quotas (e.g., max 4 ARM Cortex-M4 instances/student)  
2. **Role Hierarchy**  
   | Role | Permissions |  
   |------|-------------|  
   | Student | Start labs, Submit work |  
   | TA | Debug student sessions, Extend time |  
   | Instructor | Deploy templates, Configure auto-grading |  
3. **Real-Time Collaboration**  
   - Shared terminal sessions  
   - Multi-cursor code editing  
   - Synchronized oscilloscope views  
4. **Usage Analytics**  
   - Heatmaps of common debugging pain points  
   - Resource utilization reports
